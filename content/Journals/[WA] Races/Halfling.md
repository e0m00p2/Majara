Notes:

*   Once smaller giants, power hungry and violent, cursed with a clover addiction and blessed with luck.
*   Clovers both stunt growth and cause curiosity, hunger, and fearlessness.
*   Now known as halflings, it's not known that they're the same race
*   Due to halflings cultivation of clovers for smoking and particularly style of child bearing (born very small but able, so pregnancy is not apparent) most people believe halflings appear out of clover fields.
