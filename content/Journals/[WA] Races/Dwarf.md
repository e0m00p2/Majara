Notes: Created by [[D'mitrius Marcus|The Great Storyteller]] who cursed the [[Fuhling]] race as a precaution should they regain their power Giant slayers by nature Women made more durable to make sure the species didn't die out. Males were made using the remnants of power, making them far less durable. Matriarchy, the Women do most of the fighting, smithing, trading, traveling, and mining. Men are expected to stay at home and take care of the house, as well as help manage society in planning roles. Part of this is the women have the "Sacred Caves", which is significant to a race that spends much of its time mining and in caves.  For a long time, other races thought the females were the males of the Dwarf species due to the rampant body hair including beards and the bulky, squarish builds. The men are discouraged from traveling (They're just so fragile) so rarely were they seen. By now the truth is commonly known however, at least about the females. There are some rumors and mythology about Dwarves not having males at all, instead just capturing short humans to breed with.  Two main types, mountain dwarves and cave dwarves.
