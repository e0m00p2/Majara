\# Orcai

\*\*Orcai\*\* is a unique race in the world of Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), known for their connection to a fungal origin and their inherent violent tendencies. They are humanoid beings that spawn from massive growths called \*\*Orcai Mothers\*\*. These Mothers resemble piles of mushrooms covered in white-grey vines and move slowly in a crawl. The vines of the Orcai Mothers can stretch up to 50 feet and possess both strength and speed.

\## Physiology and Reproduction

The Orcai race has a fascinating reproductive process. Orcai Mothers are the source of new Orcai individuals. These massive growths are essentially conglomerates of unique fungus. They give birth to humanoid Orcai, a process that is accelerated when provided with food. The humanoid Orcai are birthed naturally, and their physical appearance is reminiscent of other humanoid races, albeit with certain fungal traits.

When humanoid Orcai take damage, they tend to drop spores. These spores, under suitable conditions, have the potential to grow into new Orcai individuals or even new Orcai Mothers. This unique reproductive cycle is driven by the fungal nature of the Orcai race.

\## [[Dark Elf|Dark Elves]] and Orcai Spores

The Orcai race has a notable influence on [[Elf|Elves]]. [[Elf|Elves]] infected by dormant Orcai spores experience distinctive effects, leading to what is commonly known as the \*\*[[Dark Elf|Dark Elves]]\*\*. The [[Dark Elf|Dark Elves]] tend to exhibit more refined violence and dark tendencies compared to their [[Elf|Elven]] counterparts.

In response to these effects, [[Dark Elf|Dark Elves]] often distance themselves from [[Elf|Elven]] societies and establish their own cities underground. These cities provide a space where [[Dark Elf|Dark Elves]] can indulge their desires for violence and the infliction of harm.

\## Society and Culture

Orcai society revolves around the presence of Orcai Mothers, which hold a revered status as the source of life and sustenance for the Orcai community. Humanoid Orcai typically organize themselves into tribes or clans, centered around specific Orcai Mothers. Each tribe or clan is led by a chieftain or elder who acts as a central authority and spiritual guide.

Orcai value communal living, residing in close proximity to their respective Orcai Mothers. They share resources, defend their territories, and work together to gather food, reflecting a sense of collective cooperation and interdependence.

\## Behavior and Tendencies

The Orcai race exhibits inherent violent tendencies, possibly stemming from their connection to their fungal nature and the primal instincts ingrained within them. They display aggression, battle prowess, and a desire for dominance over their adversaries. This behavior is influenced by the fungal urges to ensure the propagation and survival of the fungus that birthed them.

[[Dark Elf|Dark Elves]], influenced by the effects of Orcai spores on [[Elf|Elves]], showcase even more refined violence and dark tendencies. They tend to isolate themselves from other races, particularly [[Elf|Elven]] societies, and establish their own underground cities where they can freely express and explore their inclinations.

\## Intelligence and Instincts

Orcai possess a moderate level of intelligence, generally on the lower end of the scale compared to other races. While capable of basic problem-solving and learning, their instincts and fungal nature often influence their behavior and decision-making processes. Their instincts prioritize survival and the spread of spores for the fungus that birthed them.
