Bright Flame Sally is a force to be reckoned with, feared and respected by all members of [[The Order of the Obsidian Flame]]. Despite her tough exterior and masculine demeanor, she harbors a secret that she only reveals to those outside of the guild: her love of all things feminine. Sally is fiercely independent and has a chip on her shoulder, always trying to prove herself to be the toughest member of the Obsidian Flame. This drive to be the best has propelled her through the ranks, earning her the title of Bright Flame and the respect of her colleagues.

Sally's private life is a well-guarded secret, known only to a select few. She is single and has been for some time, but not for lack of trying. With her demanding job and the expectations placed on her as a Bright Flame, she simply does not have the time for a personal life. Additionally, Sally is wary of getting involved with someone within the guild, as she fears that revealing her feminine side to a guildmate would make them think she is weak.

Despite her tough exterior, Sally is a kind and loyal friend to those who earn her trust. She will stop at nothing to protect the citizens of [[New Graffoc|New Graffoc]] and is fiercely dedicated to her duties as a member of the Obsidian Flame. While she may not have time for love, she takes comfort in knowing that she is making a difference in the lives of others and is proud to be a part of the prestigious Guard Guild of [[New Graffoc]], The Obsidian Flame.
