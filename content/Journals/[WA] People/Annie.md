## History

Summary: captured, in child fighting ring, fights with skill and forces submission, adopts those she beats so that they are not killed or sold, all her "supply money" for weapons and armor goes to this so she only uses an old sword and no armor.

Annie was born in [[Scourre|Scourre]]Â to a pair of merchants. Tiring of the (quite literally)cutthroat competition in [[Scourre]], her parents decided to move their business to [[Barban|Barban]] when Annie turned ten, where such activities were supposedly frowned upon. However, as they first entered the country, they were beset upon by bandits just outside of Dannyripool. While the goods were stolen and Annie's parents were killed, the bandits were impressed by her skill. In [[Scourre]], all are trained to fight from a young age, no matter ones class. They happened to be associated with a popular underground arena where captured children were forced to fight to the death to the delight of the watchers.
