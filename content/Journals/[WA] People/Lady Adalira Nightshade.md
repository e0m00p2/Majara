Lady Adalira Nightshade was once a promising young sorceress who came from a wealthy and influential family. She had a natural talent for magic and was trained by some of the best magic tutors in the land. However, her thirst for power and her tendency to get involved with the wrong crowd eventually led her down a dark path. She became involved in illegal magic practices and began using her powers for personal gain. Her involvement in these activities drew the attention of the authorities and she was eventually caught. Rather than face the consequences of her actions, Adalira fled the city and took refuge in [[The Narrows]] district, where she quickly established herself as a powerful force among the criminal elements.

Despite her reputation as a criminal, Adalira is known for her intelligence, cunning, and strategic thinking. She is a natural leader and has built a network of allies and followers who are fiercely loyal to her. However, her past continues to haunt her and she is constantly looking over her shoulder, wary of being discovered and brought to justice.

Adalira is a complex and troubled character who is driven by her thirst for power and her desire to protect herself and her criminal empire. Despite her reputation as a ruthless criminal, she is known to have a soft spot for those who have been wronged and is known to offer help to those in need.
