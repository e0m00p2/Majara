# Shields Shall Be Splintered!
Shields splinter and crack, straps snap and break; all warriors know a shield is temporary possession at best but that it'll save your life in a pinch. Any time a character would take damage they can instead choose to destroy their shield and take half damage. If a shield is magical it loses one +1, then any special abilities it might have before its destruction as runes and arcane inlays are instead ruined.
