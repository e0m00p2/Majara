Suhuagin War Otters (Mustela Suhuagin)

Classification: Mustela Suhuagin, domesticated subspecies of otters

Appearance: The Suhuagin War Otters are a specially bred subspecies of otters that have been domesticated by the aquatic Suhuagin race for use in battle. They have a strong and muscular build, with dense fur that ranges from shades of green to blue. Their small size and agility make them excellent scouts and skirmishers in underwater battles.

Training: The Suhuagin War Otters are trained from a young age to be proficient in combat and reconnaissance, and are equipped with light armor and weapons such as tridents, daggers, and small shields. They are also trained in stealth, allowing them to gather intelligence.

Special Abilities: In addition to their combat training, the Suhuagin War Otters have the natural ability to manipulate objects and use tools, making them versatile in battle. They are also highly intelligent and able to carry out complex commands with the aid of magic.

Role in Suhuagin Society: The Suhuagin War Otters serve as the primary soldiers in the Suhuagin army, carrying out reconnaissance missions and participating in underwater battles. They are valued for their loyalty and bravery, but are still considered animals rather than sentient beings and not full members of Suhuagin society.

Culture: The breeding and training of Suhuagin War Otters is considered a great honor among the Suhuagin, and the otters themselves are treated with respect. They are often depicted in Suhuagin artwork and mythology as brave and loyal warriors.

Weaknesses: Despite their combat training and natural abilities, Suhuagin War Otters are still vulnerable to the same dangers that threaten all otters. They are not as well-protected as larger underwater creatures, and their small size makes them easy targets for enemy forces.

Habitat: The Suhuagin War Otters are found primarily in the underwater cities and territories of the Suhuagin race. They are adapted to living in the ocean, but are able to survive for short periods on land if necessary
