**Overview:** The Path of Endless Fury stood as a malevolent force, dedicated to the worship of [[Apollyon]], the god of Destruction, Vengeance, Hate, and Fury. This sinister organization boldly operated in plain sight, exerting control over the minds of its followers and spreading chaos and despair in the name of their merciless [[Deity]].

**Core Beliefs:**

1.  **Destruction as Devotion:** The Path emphasizes that destruction, whether of cities, civilizations, or individuals, is the highest form of devotion to [[Apollyon]].
2.  **Vengeance Unleashed:** Central to the teachings is the concept of vengeance. Adherents are encouraged to seek retribution without mercy, letting the fires of hate guide their actions.
3.  **Hatred as Power:** The church preaches that hatred is a potent source of power, asserting that the more one despises, the stronger their connection to [[Apollyon]] becomes.

2.  **Baneveil Gambit:** A clandestine tactical maneuver involving dark incantations and sacrificial offerings, the Baneveil Gambit is strategically deployed to invoke [[Apollyon]]'s malevolent essence on a targeted battlefield or fortified location. This ritual seeks to shroud the area in an otherworldly darkness, corrupting the morale of opposing forces and fostering chaos in the midst of conflict. The Baneveil Gambit aims to turn the tide of battle by unleashing [[Apollyon]]'s destructive influence on the very front lines, ensuring victory for those who invoke its dark power.

**Church Artifacts:**

1.  **Veilshredder Blade:** A cursed sword forged in the heart of [[Apollyon]]'s dark realm. It severs the fabric of reality, causing both physical and spiritual harm to those it strikes.
2.  **Crown of Eternal Spite:** Adorned with twisted spikes and dark gemstones, this crown amplifies feelings of hatred and resentment, corrupting even the noblest hearts.

**Holy Days:**
