## Mythos

Upon the very first death, of a being old and powerful beyond even the gods, [[Lord Death]] was born. Born to watch over and guide every death that followed, until the universe itself dies at which point they will undertake their final task and reap themselves.

* * *

## Origins

Born from those few people who have spoken to [[Lord Death]], the religion has spread from coast to coast in some form or another, always keeping to the core beliefs.

* * *

## Cosmology

Little is spoken of the world and it's creation. [[Lord Death]] is said to know but feels it is unwise to speak of it.

* * *

## Tenets

*   Death is not to be sought, nor feared.
*   Death comes to all, so enjoy what life you have.
*   Death wishes you to live as long as you can, so do not destroy yourself or others, unless they seek to cause greater harm.
