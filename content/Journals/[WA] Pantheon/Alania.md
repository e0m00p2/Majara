# Article
Alania, also known as The Healing Hand and She Who Forgives, is a goddess whose portfolio consists of Life, Devotion, and Order. Her symbol is a hand wreathed in silver healing energy.

### Description

Alania took many forms in her manifestation. She always had the features and race of whomever she was appearing for, with the exception of her eyes were always silver or blue and her long hair was often red or silver. Unless she was concealing her true nature, she generally appeared as a larger than life figure, ten feet tall and glowing with her healing silver aura. Unlike other Life and Devotion goddesses, she does not appear as a mother figure, instead having the willowy body of a maiden.

### Personality

Alania is much the same no matter where or when she manifested. She is possessed of a kind spirit and does not speak harmful words only encouragement even to those who consider her their enemy. She fears not for herself but for the harm others do to themselves by attempting to harm her. At times, her devotion almost makes her seem simpleminded though she is not, instead she is single-minded in her focus on her goals.

### History

Alania is one of the oldest of the known goddesses, possibly the oldest in recorded memory. She speaks little of her origins, preferring to speak of the one she is speaking to when she does communicate with mortals directly.
