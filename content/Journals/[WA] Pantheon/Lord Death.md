# Article
Lord Death is the most well known [[Deity]] of [[Updated Journals/[WA] Planes/Majara/The Fertile Lands]], known in nearly the same form in every kingdom of the civilized races. He is known as a God of Death, of course, but more importantly of Life and Peace. Unlike many Deities, he does not make grand appearances or pronouncements to his clergy, as a matter of fact he rarely speaks at all. Instead, he regularly appears among the populous, helping with inconsequential things like carrying water or helping repair a crooked door, irrespective of class or rank. Most people see Lord Death at least once before they die, perhaps his way of trying to make the transition a more comfortable one.
