# Article
An old human goddess, from the time before the [[The Great Growth]] , when humans died as often as they survived and they needed great fertility to survive. Before they had magic to inflict hardships on their enemies of the Orcs and Dark [[Elf|Elves]], among other creatures, they called upon Elesia to assist them in keeping their enemies numbers down. 

Since then the worship of Elesia and the shape of the goddess has shifted, with more of a focus on the fertility and less on plaguing enemies. She is still worshiped by more than the old days, due to the increase in population, and yet is also less popular by percentage, often only in smaller towns or outlier cities.

Elesia is safe enough to call upon for marriages and those of true faith are protected from all forms of jungle sickness. However, calling on her for the growth of crops and breeding of domestic beasts can be dangerous, as she will often bless the land as strongly as what you need, causing rampant growth of wild poisonous plants or pestilent creatures like rats, snakes, and bugs.

General Details

Firstname

Elesia

Honorific

Goddess

## Morality

Elesia's morality is shaped from an older time, far older, despite the changes in her faith over time. She has limited interest in individuals compared to modern deities and no real interest in protecting them. The only offering of protection that she has been convinced to offer, grudgingly, over the last thousand years, is protection against the plagues she often brews in the depths of her jungles. She enjoys increasing the fertility of all life that lives long enough to breed, seeking to increase the strength of the whole rather than any particular individual.
