Ellane is revered as a nurturing, motherly figure. Her philosophy is centered on the belief that those who have strayed into evil are not inherently malevolent but simply misguided and in need of guidance to return to the path of virtue.

Shaped by Stella, Ellane's persona diverges from the contemporary notion of motherhood. She believes in strict, yet fair, discipline, reflecting an older, more traditional set of values.

Her moral code emphasizes standard ethical principles, including refraining from killing and stealing, and advocating for kindness and respect in interpersonal interactions.

#### 4\. Physical Appearance

Contrary to many deities, Ellane manifests as a robust, middle-aged woman, indicative of a life engaged in physical labor like woodcutting, smithing, or farming. Her appearance is marked by the toils of work, including several scars earned while manifesting in the material plane to protect her first follower, Stella.

#### 5\. Influence and Legacy

The influence of Ellane spans various sentient races, advocating a doctrine focused on redemption and forgiveness. Her followers are known for their commitment to protecting and guiding those who have lost their way, reflecting the maternal and protective essence of their [[Deity]].
