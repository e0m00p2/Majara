## The One: Origins of Existence

### The One

The One is a mysterious entity shrouded in legends and whispered rumors, known only to a select few. [[Lord Death]], [[D'mitrius Marcus]], and [[Vel Tuck Entasida]] guard the [[Apollyon|Secrets]] of its existence closely, revealing little about the enigmatic being. According to ancient lore, The One predates the current reality, a primordial force that once encompassed everything within itself.

### The Loneliness of The One

In the eons before time took shape, The One existed in solitude, a complete and singular entity. Despite its completeness, a profound sense of loneliness consumed The One. Desiring companionship, it harnessed its unimaginable power to bring about its own end, birthing the foundation of the cosmos as we know it.

### The Transformation

As The One chose self-annihilation, its essence underwent a profound transformation, shaping the fundamental aspects of the world and planes. The body of The One manifested as the material plane, the tangible realm where mortal lives unfold. Simultaneously, its mind scattered as sparks of thought across the nascent world, giving rise to diverse creatures.

The spirit of The One transcended the material plane, weaving the intricate tapestry of the inner and outer planes. Within these ethereal realms, pure spirits and celestial beings emerged, the most potent of which evolved into entities recognized as "The Gods." These gods embodied large portions of The One's spirit, shaped by the collective minds that sprang forth from the initial spark.

### The Offspring of God's Demise

In the aftermath of The One's self-sacrifice, several significant entities emerged from the remnants of its existence. [[Lord Death]], personifying the concept of 'Ending,' came into being, serving as a cosmic force that governs the conclusion of all things. D'mitrius Markus, a fragment of The One driven by an insatiable longing for intrigue and narrative, emerged as a distinct entity with a penchant for weaving compelling stories.

[[Vel Tuck Entasida]], another aspect of The One, yearned above all else to witness the consequences of its own demise. This desire shaped [[Vel Tuck Entasida]] into a unique entity with a peculiar connection to the unfolding events in the realms.

### Whispers of The One

The knowledge of The One remains veiled in secrecy, known only to those few beings who guard the ancient truths. The tales of The One's sacrifice and the subsequent birth of the cosmos persist as whispered legends, weaving through the fabric of reality.

### Conclusion

The One's sacrifice laid the foundation for the intricate dance of existence, giving rise to the material plane, the celestial realms, and the cosmic forces that govern the universe. While the details of The One's existence remain shrouded in mystery, its influence echoes through the ages, a silent but omnipresent force that shaped the very essence of reality.
