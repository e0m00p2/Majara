Classification: Undead Flyer

Appearance

Bone Collectors are truly unique creatures, made up of bones collected from various creatures and held together by connecting cartilage that resembles flesh, serving as the material for their wings. Their appearance is quite eerie, as the bones are haphazardly assembled, giving them a chaotic and unpredictable appearance.

Hunting Behavior

Bone Collectors are highly efficient hunters, using their life sense which extends up to 100 feet, and blindsight up to 30 feet, to locate potential prey. Once they have found their target, they will dive down to attack, striking at the creature's vulnerable points. They are highly agile creatures, capable of diving down and then quickly soaring back up into the air, making them difficult to hit with ranged attacks.

Origins

Bone Collectors were created by the protospecies [[Havrosil]] thousands of years ago through the use of necromancy. Originally, they were used as scouts by the [[Havrosil]] and were imbued with the ability to bond telepathically with a single target within sight. This bond allows the Bone Collector to communicate telepathically with the bonded creature at any distance.

Abilities

Bone Collectors possess an unique ability that sets them apart from other undead creatures: they are able to fly without rest. This has allowed them to avoid the purging influence of the great growths, making them highly adaptable and resilient creatures.

Conclusion

Bone Collectors are truly remarkable creatures, both in appearance and abilities. Their use of necromancy to create and maintain their existence is both fascinating and terrifying. Despite their eerie appearance, they serve as a testament to the power and potential of necromancy. Despite being long forgotten by many, their presence continues to captivate and intrigue those who encounter them. It is important to remember that Bone Collectors are highly dangerous creatures, and should be approached with caution. However, for those who are able to study and learn about these fascinating creatures, they offer a glimpse into a rich and fascinating history of necromancy and the ancient cultures that once utilized its power. Overall, Bone Collectors are an important and integral part of the world's history and mythology, and their legacy continues to endure to this day.
