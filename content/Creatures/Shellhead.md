"Shellhead" - A Hybrid Species of Mastiff and Giant Armadillo

Classification:

Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Carnivora Family: Canidae Genus: Canis Species: Canis domesticus hybridus

Physical Characteristics:

Shellheads resemble mostly dogs, with a heavy shell around their head and more flexible overlapping plates covering their back and sides. They are large, sturdy animals with powerful jaws and strong legs, well suited for carrying heavy packs and riders. Their shells provide a significant amount of protection from attacks, making them popular as war mounts, for all that they are slightly slower and less nimble than their pure canine companions.

Diet:

The diet of Shellheads is mostly carnivorous, consisting of meat and occasionally some plant material. They are known to have a strong preference for meat, especially fresh meat, and will often hunt or scavenge for food in urban areas.

Behavior:

Shellheads are highly intelligent and social animals, often forming close bonds with their owners or riders. They are highly trainable and have been used for many purposes, including as war mounts, guard dogs, and even as therapy animals. They have a strong instinct to protect their pack and will fiercely defend them against any perceived threats. However, they can be friendly and affectionate with people they trust and are often considered loyal companions.

Habitat:

As they are created via magic and breeding, Shellheads have no native habitat outside of the urban environment. They are often kept as pets or used as working animals by their owners, and can adapt well to various living conditions in urban areas.

Conservation Status:

The conservation status of Shellheads is unknown. However, their popularity as war mounts and pets has led to widespread breeding and domestication, making them a common species in urban areas.
