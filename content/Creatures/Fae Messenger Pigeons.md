Entomology: Fae Messenger Pigeons are a unique strain of domesticated pigeons that have been bred for their incredible messaging abilities. They are the result of interbreeding with a bird gifted from the Queen of Air several hundred years ago. This interbreeding has resulted in a strain of pigeons with the ability to teleport short distances, allowing them to cover more ground and avoid threats like predatory birds.

History: The origins of the Fae Messenger Pigeons can be traced back several hundred years, to when a bird gifted from the Queen of Air was interbred with domesticated pigeons. Over time, this interbreeding has resulted in a strain of pigeons with incredible messaging abilities, and the Fae Messenger Pigeons have become an essential tool for communication in many cultures. Their ability to teleport short distances has made them especially valuable for delivering messages over long distances, and they continue to be highly valued in many communities today.
