The Glyphwall District is a dedicated area within the city of [[New Graffoc|New Graffoc]] for the wizarding community. It is a walled enclosure that is separate from the material plane, giving it more space within than without. The walls of the district are covered in arcane runes, known as the Glyphwall, which serve several purposes. Firstly, they act as a communication hub for the wizarding community, allowing for quick and secure transmission of information and magic. Secondly, they help in protecting the district from outside influences and unauthorized access, as attempting to enter or leave the Glyphwall anywhere other than the gates can result in undesirable side effects.

Within the Glyphwall District, wizards can find a variety of amenities and facilities to support their lives and work. There are wizard housing options, such as wizard towers, available to those who have graduated from the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry located within the district. There are also wizard-only taverns, shops, and guild halls for members of the wizarding community to gather and interact. Additionally, the district is home to Arcane Libraries, research and development centers, and other facilities for the study and practice of magic.

Overall, the Glyphwall District is a hub of magical activity and learning, with a focus on the advancement of the arcane arts. Access to the district is limited and controlled, and it is considered a privilege to be able to live and work within its walls.
