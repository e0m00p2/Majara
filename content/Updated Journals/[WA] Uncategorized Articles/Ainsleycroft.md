# Article
A decent sized village south of [[Updated Journals/[WA] Uncategorized Articles/New Graffoc|New Graffoc]] that mainly produces food and timber. A relativelyÂ safe distance from both mountains and sea, plus the residence of a powerful wizard, means that for the most part Ainsleycroft is a peaceful place with little in the way of defenses and disturbances. It would not normally have a stop on the Teleport Network but for the residence of **Palimum Chukhail** The Fleshshaper.
