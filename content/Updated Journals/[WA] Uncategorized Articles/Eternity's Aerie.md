**Introduction** In the remote and nearly inaccessible Skyward Peaks, a unique civilization of Aarakocra thrives, governed by an ancient and wise council known as the "Eternity's Aerie." This council is composed of five Aarakocra liches, beings of great power who have transcended death through a rare and non-evil form of lichdom. The Eternity's Aerie is not only the governing body but also the keepers of ancient knowledge, guiding their people with wisdom accumulated over centuries.

**History** The Eternity's Aerie was founded nearly a millennium ago, born from a necessity to preserve the rapidly fading knowledge and culture due to the short lifespan of the Aarakocra. The first of the liches, Talon Sagefeather, discovered a method to transcend death without succumbing to evil, a technique involving a deep communion with the natural forces and a selfless dedication to their people. Over centuries, this council has seen the rise and fall of empires, the ebb and flow of magic, and the evolution of the world below. Each lich, upon feeling their time drawing to a close, selects a successor, imparting their knowledge and wisdom before finally allowing themselves to pass on.

**Current Members of the Eternity's Aerie**

*   **Skyseer Whirlwindclaw** - The eldest of the current council, a master of divination and weather magic. Whirlwindclaw has a calm, contemplative demeanor and is revered for their prophetic insights.
*   **Stormcaller Brightfeather** - A master of elemental magic, Brightfeather is known for their vibrant plumage and fiery spirit. They are passionate about protecting the Skyward Peaks and often lead defenses against external threats.
*   **Sage Wingwhisper** - The keeper of lore and history, Wingwhisper is the most scholarly of the council. Their vast knowledge spans multiple disciplines, from ancient cultures to arcane mysteries.
*   **Windwalker Silentbeak** - A master of stealth and subtlety, Silentbeak is the eyes and ears of the council. They specialize in gathering information and maintaining the secrecy of their practices.
*   **Starwatcher Nightfeather** - The newest member, fascinated with the stars and celestial movements. Nightfeather is deeply involved in astrology and cosmic magic, often meditating on the future of their people.

**Culture and Society Under the Eternity's Aerie** Under the guidance of the Eternity's Aerie, Aarakocra society in the Skyward Peaks has flourished. The council's wisdom has led to advancements in magic, art, and technology, all harmoniously blended with their reverence for nature and the skies. Their isolation has preserved their unique way of life, though occasionally, curious Aarakocra venture beyond their borders to share and gather knowledge.

**Rituals and Ceremonies** Key to the society are the rituals surrounding the transition of a new lich into the Eternity's Aerie. These ceremonies are a blend of celebration and solemnity, marking the continuation of their ancient legacy. The process of choosing a successor is a deeply spiritual and communal affair, involving visions, trials, and the approval of both the existing council and the community.

**Relations with the Outside World** The Skyward Peaks and its inhabitants are shrouded in mystery. Few outside of their race have ever witnessed the Eternity's Aerie or the wonders of their high-altitude sanctuaries. However, the council occasionally sends envoys to the world below, either to gather information or to intervene in events that might threaten the balance of nature or the world at large.

**Challenges and Aspirations** The Eternity's Aerie faces the continual challenge of balancing the preservation of their culture with the need to adapt to an ever-changing world. Their current focus is on understanding the shifting magics of the world and preparing their people for changes that the future might bring.
