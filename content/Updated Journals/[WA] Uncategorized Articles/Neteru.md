Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Carnivora Family: Canidae Genus: Lupus Species: Lupus Neterus

Entomology: The Neteru is a unique species of animal with celestial origins. It is believed to have been created by the [[Elf|Elves]], who grafted the spirit of their dying god onto an existing species of animal. The resulting Neteru is a combination of both animal and divine energies, possessing characteristics and abilities beyond those of typical beasts.

Description: The Neteru is a quadrupedal creature that resembles a mixture of a wolf and a bear. It has a shaggy coat of fur that can range in color from brown, black, to white, and has a shimmering quality that reflects light in an otherworldly manner. It has a broad head with piercing yellow eyes, a strong jaw and large fangs, and a sturdy, muscular body with powerful legs and a thick tail. The fur is soft to the touch and helps the Neteru blend in with its surroundings.

Ecology: When unbonded, Neteru generally live in deep forests and other remote areas. They are solitary creatures that only interact with other Neteru during mating season. Their diet primarily consists of large game such as deer and elk, but they are capable of adapting to their surroundings and will hunt smaller prey if necessary.

Behavior: Neteru have slightly above average intelligence compared to other mammals until they bond, at which point their intelligence increases to on par with whatever they've bonded with. They have a strong sense of loyalty and protectiveness towards their bonded companion. They communicate with their bonded telepathically, and have the ability to project their health onto their bonded, taking damage instead of them. Despite this, they do not offer any additional benefits to their bonded beyond protection.

History: The exact history of the Neteru is not well known, as the knowledge of their creation has been passed down only among the [[Elf|Elves]]. However, it is believed that the [[Elf|Elves]] created the Neteru as a way for their dying god to still have a presence in the world, and to protect and care for creatures in need of protection. Over time, the Neteru has become a valued companion to many different races and is revered for its loyalty and strength.
