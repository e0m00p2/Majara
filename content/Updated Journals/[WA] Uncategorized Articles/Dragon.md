## Dragons: The Material Essence

Dragons in the world of **Majara** are a unique and enigmatic presence. Unlike many creatures, dragons are born purely of the material plane, lacking the touch of spiritual or mental essence that characterizes other beings. This distinct origin shapes not only their physiology but also the way they think and interact with the world around them.

### A Different Kind of Intelligence

The absence of spiritual and mental essence does not imply a lack of intelligence in Majara dragons. However, it does mean that their intelligence functions differently, and they lack the innate connections that many other thinking beings possess.

### Manifestations of the Material Plane

Majara dragons represent different aspects of the material plane, each associated with distinct colors and properties. For example:

Green dragons embody poisons, venoms, toxins, and all related concepts. Black dragons represent the inexorable force of entropy and the breakdown of all things. Blue dragons are connected to storms, the air, and the sea. White dragons embody the essence of cold and ice.

These manifestations are not just superficial; they influence the abilities and behaviors of the dragons.

### The Cycle of Life and Death

Dragons in Majara do not experience life and death as mortal creatures do. Instead, they lack an inherent part that ceases to exist upon their death. When a Majara dragon dies, its body breaks down to rejoin the material plane, and it is reborn elsewhere. Typically, this rebirth takes the form of an egg, which eventually hatches into a new dragon. Over time, the dragon regains the memories of its previous life.

### Profound Environmental Influence

The presence of a Majara dragon has a significant impact on the land nearby. Dragons are concentrated essences of the material plane, causing several effects:

**Half-Dragons:** Their presence can lead to the birth of half-dragon individuals nearby. **Environmental Warping:** The environment is warped and altered in their vicinity. **Other Effects:** Exposure to a dragon's horde, which is considered a part of its body, can also lead to various effects, including partial transformation or even appearing to have a cancer-like effect.

### The Danger of Dragons

Interacting with dragons in Majara is fraught with danger, both in a general and specific sense. Their unique nature and the potential side effects of being in their presence make them unpredictable and challenging to deal with. Chromatic dragons, in particular, represent concepts that are untameable by humans, leading to their classification as "evil." This designation is not because the dragons themselves are inherently malicious but rather because they are fundamentally incompatible with Human society. In contrast, metallic dragons, like the metals they represent, are more malleable and can generally collaborate with humans and other sentient races.

### Mystical Barrier and Material Essence

Dragons in Majara have a profound urge to expand their lairs and hoards, a drive that is far from human understanding. This relentless accumulation serves a cryptic purpose â€” it strengthens the very fabric of the Material Plane. Dragons believe that the material essence they gather functions as a protective barrier against eldritch beings that exist outside of The Great Wheel, entities beyond mortal comprehension.

The amassed treasures and artifacts they hoard aren't mere displays of wealth but the building blocks of this mystical defense. With each addition to their hoard, the borders of the Material Plane are fortified. Dragons perceive this as their sacred duty, a cosmic guardianship that transcends human understanding.
