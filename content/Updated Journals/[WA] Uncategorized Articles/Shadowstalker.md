Classification: Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Carnivora Family: Shadowstalkeridae Genus: Shadowstalker Species: Shadowstalker ferox

Appearance: The Shadowstalker is a formidable predator with a distinctive appearance. Standing at an average height of 6 feet tall, this quadrupedal monster has black, oily skin that reflects no light. Its body is covered in sharp, jagged spines that emit a menacing red glow in the dark. Its eyes are two glowing, golden orbs that can pierce through even the thickest darkness. The Shadowstalker is nearly silent, moving with fluid grace that belies its massive size.

Diet: As a predator, the Shadowstalker feeds on any living creature it can find. It is capable of consuming entire herds of animals in a single night and is known to attack humans who venture too close to its territory.

Hunting Methods: The Shadowstalker is a master of stealth, able to disappear into the shadows at a moment's notice. It will stalk its prey for hours, watching and waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Once it has chosen its target, the Shadowstalker will attack with lightning speed, its sharp spines piercing through flesh and bone with ease. Additionally, when out of direct light, it can become partially insubstantial, ignoring difficult terrain and terrain damage and able to move through spaces as small as 1 inch.

Weaknesses: Despite its formidable abilities, the Shadowstalker does have a weakness. It is vulnerable to bright light, which causes its spines to lose their red glow and its body to become tangible once more. Exposure to bright light for an extended period of time will disorient the Shadowstalker and make it easier to defeat.

Lost Knowledge: Despite being a well-known monster, little is known about the origin of the Shadowstalker. Some ancient texts suggest that it was created by a mad wizard as a tool of destruction, but the true nature of the creature remains a mystery. Those who have attempted to study it have often met with gruesome ends. Some scholars believe that the Shadowstalker may be connected to the shadows themselves, drawing its power from the darkness and using it to fuel its insatiable hunger. However, these theories remain unproven and the true nature of the Shadowstalker remains shrouded in mystery
