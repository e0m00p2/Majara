## History

An ancient [[Elf]] spellsmith([[Varis Amanodel]])wrought weapon originally hailing from Fadaban. Made from a chunk of sky metal and woven with ancient [[Elf|Elven]] spellsong, it glows with moonlight at its name and has unearthly accuracy. It was passed down in the Amanodel family for two generations before they passed it to a half blood offspring. This half [[Elf]] girl by the name of [[Ara Amanodel]] decided to leave the [[Elf]] lands of her own will and settled in [[Updated Journals/[WA] Countries/Barban|Barban]], eventually becoming known as Seedspeaker. She and her allies traveled the length and breadth of [[Barban]] slaying the natural born undead that rose in the high magic concentration kingdom and becoming known as [[The Stingers]] and heroes to many in [[Barban]]. At their death they were entombed together by their own direction with their greatest possessions, including Kochav Charav.
