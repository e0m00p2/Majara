The oldest guild of wizardry in the Magocracy of [[Updated Journals/[WA] Countries/Barban|Barban]], The Eldest Arcane is arguably the origin of the Magocracy, when a group of wizards set up shop here to suppress the rampant Necromancy in the area. Over time, they gathered students, forbidding entirely the practice of Necromancy and most of Enchantment schools as they found these magics to be most commonly twisted to horrible purpose. As the area around them became safe, others came and trade began to flourish along the river. Before long, they had a thriving city around the core of their Wizards School.
