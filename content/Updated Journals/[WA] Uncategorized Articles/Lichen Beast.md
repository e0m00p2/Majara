Kingdom: Fungi Class: Lichenes Order: Unknown Family: Unknown Genus: Unknown Species: Lichen Beast (L. beast)

Physical Description

The Lichen Beast is a highly aggressive underground monster that is made entirely of lichen. It has unusual shapes and angles, with no regularly shaped head or recognizable appendages, and its mass can range from a few meters to several tens of meters in diameter. The creature is green in color, and its skin is rough and porous, providing it with a means to absorb nutrients.

Diet

The Lichen Beast gains most of its nutrients by breaking down corpses inside its mass. However, its precise diet is unknown, and it is believed that it can consume any organic matter that it comes into contact with.

Hunting Methods

The Lichen Beast will hunt down and consume anything that gets within its sensory range. It is known for its highly aggressive behavior and will take on creatures much larger than itself without hesitation. The creature has limited fear and will not retreat from danger.

Weaknesses

Fire is the Lichen Beast's only known weakness. It appears to have an instinctive fear of fire, as it prevents both its unnaturally fast healing and its ability to reanimate corpses. Without fire, it is almost impossible to kill a Lichen Beast.

Lost Knowledge

The origin of the Lichen Beast and its abilities are not known by modern scholars. It is believed that the creature was created by the protoraces, a now-extinct race that once dominated the world. The name "[[Orc]] Mother" was given to the creature by the protoraces because of one of its more disturbing tendencies, which was to infect corpses with its lichen and reanimate them as new creatures, known as orcs, short for Organic Reanimated Creatures.

It is said that the orcs were similar in appearance to the Lichen Beast and were covered in its green lichen skin. The process of reanimation was referred to as "infection," and the orcs were capable of infecting other creatures through killing them or through the process of death. If the body of an [[Orc]] was not disposed of correctly, it would bloat and eventually explode, sending fragments of the lichen in every direction. The orcs were highly aggressive, and they would infect and kill anything that crossed their path.

Despite its disturbing abilities, very little is known about the Lichen Beast and its origin. Its precise biology and anatomy, as well as its motivations and behavior, remain a mystery to modern scholars. The exploration of ruins of the protoraces for their records is a dangerous endeavor, and only the most determined and esoteric scholars are willing to risk life and limb to uncover the truth about the Lichen Beast and its role in the history of the world
