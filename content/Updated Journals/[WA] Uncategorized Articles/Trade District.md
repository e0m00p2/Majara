# Article
A bustling market full of bright colors and loud noises. You can see all sorts of potions, scrolls, and dusts for sale as well as alchemical reagents of all sorts. Unusual devices and trinkets unknown to those who are not trained in arcane magic, alchemy, or enchanting are common here. Outside of this there are quality luxuries unavailable in smaller markets, from excellently dyed fabrics to perfectly reflective mirrors. Vendors use small magic talents to draw the eye, changing the colors of their signs, causing bursts of light or smoke.
