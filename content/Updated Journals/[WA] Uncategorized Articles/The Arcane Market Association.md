The Arcane Market Association, commonly known as the AMA, is a powerful organization within [[Updated Journals/[WA] Uncategorized Articles/New Graffoc|New Graffoc]]. Its members include merchants, tradespeople, and other business owners who deal in magic goods and services. The main role of the AMA is to facilitate commerce within the city, ensuring that goods and services are exchanged fairly and that prices are set at reasonable levels. The AMA also provides a range of services to its members, including assistance with financial transactions, legal support, and market research.

The AMA is led by a council of experienced and successful merchants and tradespeople, who make decisions on behalf of the organization and represent its members in negotiations with other organizations and governments. The AMA also operates an extensive network of contacts and agents who help to maintain order within the city's markets and provide a quick response to any issues or disputes that may arise.

In addition to its role in facilitating commerce, the AMA also plays an important role in regulating the sale of magic goods and services within the city. The AMA is responsible for issuing required permits to merchants who wish to sell magic items and ensuring that they comply with all relevant laws and regulations. The AMA also works to prevent the sale of illegal or dangerous magic goods, and cooperates with other organizations, such as [[The Order of the Obsidian Flame]], [[The ATF]], and the [[Spellweavers' Society]], to maintain the safety and security of the city. With its wealth and influence, the Arcane Market Association is a powerful force in the city, and its members enjoy a high level of prosperity and respect.

The Arcane Market Association is unique in that it operates under a council of three, rather than a single [[Guildmaster]]. The three members of the council are:

*   [[Adriana Silverfrost]], Chairman of Commerce
*   [[Samuel Ravenwood]], Vice Chairman of Trade Relations
*   [[Evelyn Dawnlight]], Secretary of Finance and Regulations

Together, these three individuals form the leadership of the Arcane Market Association, working together to ensure that commerce within the city runs smoothly and fairly.
