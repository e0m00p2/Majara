The "Treasure Gnome" is a strange and elusive creature that inhabits the dark and mysterious depths of the underground world. Originally thought to be a myth or legend, recent encounters with these creatures have revealed them to be a devolved form of gnome magic item makers.

Appearance The Treasure Gnome is a small, gnome-like creature with a distinctive, hunched over posture. Its skin is a pale gray-brown color, it's eyes are large and black, and its nose is flat and broad. It has hard sharp claws on its hands and feet, which it uses to dig and tunnel through even solid stone.

Behavior The Treasure Gnome is a solitary creature, and is known to live in maze-like warrens that it creates beneath the earth. It is highly territorial, and will fiercely defend its lair and its collection of magic items. Despite its devolved state, the Treasure Gnome has a deep understanding of magic, and is able to instinctively identify and collect magic items.

Hunting and Feeding The Treasure Gnome is a thief and a scavenger, using its ability to tunnel through solid stone to steal magic items from above-ground dwellings and hoards. It is particularly drawn to powerful and rare magic items, which it will hoard and "study" in its lair. Despite its small size, the Treasure Gnome is a formidable opponent, using its cunning and its knowledge of magic to outwit and overpower those who venture too close to its lair.

Weaknesses Despite its formidable collection of magic items, the Treasure Gnome is not invincible. It is vulnerable to bright light and loud noises, which can disorient and confuse it. Additionally, its magic item collection is its greatest weakness, as destroying or removing the items from its lair can weaken or even kill the Treasure Gnome. Those who venture into its lair should be cautious, as the Treasure [[Gnomes]] maze-like tunnels can be difficult to navigate, and it is not above setting traps for those who would steal its treasures.

Ecology The origins of the Treasure Gnome are shrouded in mystery, with theories ranging from a devolved form of gnome magic item makers to the result of a cloning experiment gone wrong. Regardless of its origins, the Treasure Gnome has become a unique and intriguing part of the underground world, adapting to its environment and using its magic abilities to survive and thrive in the depths below.

In conclusion, the Treasure Gnome is a fascinating and dangerous creature that should be approached with caution. Its knowledge of magic and its maze-like warrens make it a formidable opponent, but those who are brave enough to face it may be richly rewarded with its hoard of magic items.
