# Article
The Skulking Ape is a carnivorous primate native to the dense tropical forests of the world of [[Majara]]. Unlike its solitary counterparts, this elusive creature is a highly social animal, forming packs to hunt its prey from above in the tree branches.

Appearance

The Skulking Ape is a large, fur-covered primate with long, powerful arms and legs. It has a broad, flat face with piercing green eyes and a sharp, hooked beak. Its fur is a mottled green-brown, allowing it to blend in with the foliage of the forest canopy.

Ecology

The Skulking Ape is an apex predator, at the top of the food chain in the tropical forests where it resides. It is an opportunistic hunter, feeding on a variety of prey including birds, small mammals, and reptiles. The Skulking Ape moves through the trees with great agility, using its powerful arms and legs to swing from branch to branch as it stalks its prey.

Behavior

The Skulking Ape is a highly social creature, forming packs of 2-6 individuals to hunt together. They communicate using a series of vocalizations and body language, but do not have a true language. Despite their pack mentality, the Skulking Ape is still highly intelligent, using its sharp senses and keen intuition to track its prey. When they spot their target, they will silently creep up behind it, using their powerful arms to snatch their prey and drag it up into the safety of the tree branches.

Fighting the Skulking Ape

The Skulking Ape is a formidable opponent, with powerful arms and a razor-sharp beak. Adventurers who find themselves face to face with a pack of Skulking Apes should be well-prepared and ready to defend themselves if necessary. A wise adventurer would do well to come armed with a sturdy weapon, as well as a means to climb the trees and reach the creatures.

Interesting Fact

The Skulking Ape has a strange habit of collecting trinkets from humanoids it kills, and even uses simple tools in its hunting. These trinkets are stored in a special cache within its lair, and serve no apparent purpose other than as a display of its kills.

In Conclusion

The Skulking Ape is a dangerous predator that should not be underestimated. Its ability to stalk its prey from above and its powerful arms, combined with its pack mentality, make it a formidable foe. Adventurers who venture into the dense tropical forests of [[Majara]] should be aware of this creature and be prepared to defend themselves if necessary.
