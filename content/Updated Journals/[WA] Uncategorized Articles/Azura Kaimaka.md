## History

Much like her daughter [[Rosa the Gypsy]], Azura was raised to be [[Calursa]], being trained in the ways of their blade dance and leadership from a young age. Unlike her daughter however, Azura's mother was killed in a large scale battle with an [[Orc]] incursion against [[Datlas]] as a whole and she had to assume the role of [[Calursa]] at a very young age.
