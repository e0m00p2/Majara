# Article
New Graffoc is the capital city of [[Barban|Barban]], located in a magical world where the use of magic is highly valued. People without magic, referred to as munds, are often pitied and viewed as inferior. The city is ruled by the [[Archmage]] [[Conifer Hythirian]], although most of the power is delegated to various civic guilds, making it a city run by a guild council of sorts.

Joining a guild is highly encouraged, as those who are not part of a guild are charged more for goods and services and are paid less for their labor. This makes the guild system an integral part of life in New Graffoc. The various guilds range from wizardry and combat magic to bardic performance and scholarship, catering to a variety of interests and skills.

However, not everyone in the city is part of a guild, and the poor and criminal elements often operate outside of the guild system. [[The Narrows]] district is where much of this population can be found, and it is known as the bad part of town.

In New Graffoc, the use of magic is heavily regulated. The sale of non-consumable magic items requires a permit, and the use of undead and necromancy is strictly forbidden under penalty of death. Enchantment magic that influences the will of another is also illegal. Despite these restrictions, New Graffoc remains a city where magic is at the forefront and is considered the most important aspect of life.

The rivers and streams that flow through the jungle are also an important source of fresh water and a crucial transportation route for goods and people.

Even more critical than these everyday resources, the jungle is also home to a variety of magical creatures, whose body parts and magical properties are highly sought after by the city's mages and sorcerers. These creatures include colorful, luminescent plants that can be used for divination, giant insects with potent venom, and powerful beasts that can be tamed and trained for use in battle.

## History

The history of New Graffoc is shrouded in both magic and discrimination. The city is located in the heart of [[Barban]], a land abundant with ambient magic and, unfortunately, a large number of undead. In response to the growing threat posed by these dangers, a small group of [[Elf|Elves]] established a magic academy in the region with the goal of teaching humans how to harness the power of magic and defend themselves. As time passed, New Graffoc grew into a bustling city, but not without its flaws. The ruling class, consisting of the magical elite, became increasingly dismissive and discriminatory towards those without magical abilities. This led to a division between the "mages" and "munds" within the city, with the former enjoying the fruits of their power and the latter struggling to make ends meet. Despite these shortcomings, New Graffoc remains a hub of magical activity, attracting practitioners of the arcane arts from far and wide. The city is also home to a variety of magical creatures, both friendly and hostile, adding to its already rich tapestry of intrigue and danger. The history of New Graffoc is ongoing and continues to be shaped by the actions of its residents, both magical and non-magical alike.

The stone used is often a unique type of marble that is infused with magic, giving it an otherworldly quality. The style of architecture is a mix of traditional and fantastical, with elements of [[Elf|Elven]] and human design. The structures are adorned with intricate carvings and designs, depicting scenes from the city's history and mythical creatures from the surrounding jungles.
