Appearance:

The Storm Boar is a large omnivorous mammal that resembles a boar, with a thick and muscular body, short legs and a short snout. The most striking feature of the Storm Boar is its two organic metal horns that generate lightning between them. These horns are made of an unknown metal and are highly conductive, allowing the Storm Boar to generate bolts of lightning that can reach up to 100 feet. The fur of the Storm Boar is thick and shaggy, and it ranges in color from dark gray to black, providing excellent camouflage in its natural habitat.

Diet:

The Storm Boar is omnivorous, feeding on a variety of plants, roots, and fruits, as well as small mammals, birds, and reptiles. When food is scarce, they have been known to hunt larger animals, using their lightning bolts to stun and kill their prey.

Behavior:

Storm Boars are territorial creatures and are known for their aggressive and bad-tempered behavior. They live in groups consisting of one male and several females, with the male defending his territory and harem from all other creatures. They are known to drive away their own young the first time they go into musk, often as not wounding or killing them.

Habitat:

The natural habitat of the Storm Boar is unknown, but it is believed to be either a boar that was influenced by a portal to the elemental chaos many centuries ago, or possibly native to that place. No references to these creatures have been found in documents referring to the elemental planes, so their true origin remains a mystery.

Special Abilities:

In addition to their lightning-generating horns, the Storm Boar has the ability to take to the air for several minutes a day, surrounding themselves in gusting winds. This ability allows them to travel quickly over long distances and escape danger when necessary
