# Article
Guildmaster is a rather complicated rank. On the surface all Guildmasters are equal, but when you look at the finer details it doesn't quite work out that way. A more powerful Guild makes a more powerful Guildmaster, or at least in the areas of power that Guild specializes in. A wealthy Guildmaster might have more clout than an influential, depending on where they are. The size of a Guild also influences the Guildmasters perceived ranking, as larger guilds generally are considered more successful.
