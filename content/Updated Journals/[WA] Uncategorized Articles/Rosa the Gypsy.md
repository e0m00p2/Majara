# Article
From the far land of RukarthÂ . Very small degree of personal space, tends to stand and sit closer than most are comfortable with in this magocricy. Speaks with an unusual accent.

I have different assumptions from those around me concerning personal space, blithely invading others' space in innocence, or reacting to ignorant invasion of my own. I begin or end my day with small traditional rituals that are unfamiliar to those around me. Open. I have much to learn from the kindly folk I meet along my way. (Good) My freedom is my most precious possession. I'll never let anyone take it from me again. I pretend not to understand the local language in order to avoid interactions I would rather not have.
