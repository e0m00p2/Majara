Tucket-Tail Classification:

Kingdom: Animalia

Phylum: Chordata

Class: Mammalia

Order: Diprotodontia

Family: Tucket-tails

Genus: Velentas

Species: Velentas Tucketi

Physical Characteristics: The Tucket-tail is a small, marsupial animal that stands about one foot tall. It has no tail and its ears are positioned on top of its head. Its eyes are large and expressive, giving it an adorable appearance. The creature is moderately fluffy with soft fur that is typically brown, gray, or black. It has no self-defense abilities and is only a moderate climber.

Diet: The Tucket-tail is primarily herbivorous, showing a strong preference for fruit and vegetables. It will also eat meat if there is no other food available, but it is not a preferred food source.

Behavior: The Tucket-tail is an extremely friendly and playful creature, willing to approach anyone or anything with food. It is not aggressive and will accept cuddles and pets of any kind. The creature shows no interest in breeding and has no aggressive responses to any stimulus. It is highly interested in eating and playing, and will not show a flight response even in dangerous situations.

Habitat: Tucket-tails are found in a variety of environments, but they are most commonly seen in areas with abundant food sources. They are not particular about their living conditions and will make their homes in a variety of environments.

Conservation Status: The Tucket-tail's unique ability to regrow from its remains makes its conservation status difficult to determine. It is widely accepted that the creature is the result of a prank by the gnome God Vel Tuck Entaside or the immortal gnome [[Matilda The Demented]], but there is no evidence to support this claim.

Special Characteristics: One of the most remarkable things about the Tucket-tail is its ability to immediately drop dead at the first sign of stress, such as uncomfortable confinement or pain. Three to ten days later, a new version of the creature identical to the old one grows into existence. This ability has led some to consider the Tucket-tail a godsend, but most people accept it as a prank by one of the gnome gods. The Tucket-tail is also unique in that it shows no interest in breeding, despite having genders. This, combined with its friendly and playful nature, makes it a popular pet in many cultures.
