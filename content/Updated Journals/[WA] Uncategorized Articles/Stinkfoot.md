Classification: Omnivore, Subtype: Carrion-Eater Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Xenarthra Family: Vermilingua Genus: Putridus Species: Putridus Carrionus

Entomology: The Putridus Carrionus, known colloquially as "Stinkfoot", is a bipedal omnivore that can consume anything for nutrients. It has a voracious appetite, commonly eating long-rotted food, excrement, and other things that most creatures avoid. Due to its unusual diet, it produces an awful-smelling slime that coats its body, which acts as a deterrent to most predators.

Description: The Putridus Carrionus is a bipedal mammal that stands upright on two thick legs. Its body is covered in a thick layer of putrid-smelling slime. Its skin is a sickly pale color and its eyes are small and beady. It has a large, gaping mouth with razor-sharp teeth and a flexible jaw that can open wide enough to consume objects larger than its head. Its limbs are sturdy, ending in sharp claws that it uses to scavenge and defend itself.

Ecology: The Putridus Carrionus is a scavenger, feeding on anything it can find. It lives in a variety of environments, including forests, swamps, and deserts, but it prefers to stay near sources of waste and decay. It is able to tolerate a wide range of temperatures, from hot to cold, but it prefers warm, humid climates where its putrid slime is most effective.

Behavior: The Putridus Carrionus is a solitary creature, avoiding contact with other beings whenever possible. It is not aggressive, but it will defend itself if it feels threatened. Its primary defense is its putrid slime, which emits a noxious odor that repels most predators. If a predator persists, the Putridus Carrionus will use its sharp claws to defend itself.

History: The origins of the Putridus Carrionus are not well known, but it is believed to have evolved from a species of scavenging mammals that adapted to consume even the most rotten and decayed of substances. Despite its repulsive appearance and odor, it has played an important role in the ecosystem by breaking down and recycling waste.
