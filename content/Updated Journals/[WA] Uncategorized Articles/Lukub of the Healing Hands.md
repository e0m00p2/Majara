# Article
Rather unofficious for a priest of his rank, Lukub tends to wear common clothing with only his amulet of The Healing Hand  to identify him as a cleric. He fits in well among common folk and this is part of what helps him preach to them well and garner their support for the Lady [[Alania]]

## History

Born in [[Moirea]], he was orphaned to The Healing Hand at a young age and ended up joining the clergy. After establishing his abilities, he was given a dream by the goddess to go spread her word to other lands, lands of magic. Interpreting this as [[Barban]], the magocricy, he took the next trading ship out along with his most devoted clerics, to spread the word of The Healing Hand.
