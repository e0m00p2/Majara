# Article
Nobody stays angry at me or around me for long, since I can defuse any amount of tension. I'm a hopeless romantic, always searching for that "special someone." Creativity. The world is in need of new ideas and bold action. (Chaotic) I idolize a hero of the old tales and measure my deeds against that person's. Longtail. I once satirized a noble who still wants my head. It was a mistake that I will likely repeat.
