Classification: Aula Felina

Appearance: The Karamatu is a quadrupedal creature that resembles a cross between a large wild cat and a wolf. It has a sleek, black fur that is almost as hard as steel, and piercing green eyes that gleam in the dark. Its body is muscular with sharp claws used for hunting and climbing.

Diet: The Karamatu is a carnivorous predator, feeding on large wild hooved mammals and smaller animals, livestock, and carrion. Its sense of smell is incredibly sharp, allowing it to track its prey from miles away.

Hunting Methods: The Karamatu is a pack hunter, relying on teamwork to take down its prey. It uses its powerful howl to coordinate its attacks with its pack mates.

Special Abilities: The Karamatu's most unique feature is its gravity-manipulating organ, which allows it to produce a howl that can manipulate gravity within a certain area. When the Karamatu howls, objects within its vicinity can become lighter or heavier, making it easier or harder for prey or predators to move. This gives the Karamatu pack a strategic advantage in hunting and defense.

Habitat: The Karamatu is native to the dark forests of the world, specifically dense and shadowy woods. It is a pack animal, living and hunting in groups.

Culture: The Karamatu is feared by many cultures for its piercing howl and is often hunted for its valuable pelt. However, some cultures worship the Karamatu for its power and fearlessness, leaving offerings of food and tribute at the edge of its territory.

Weakness: The Karamatu's gravity-manipulating organ makes it vulnerable to strong magnetic fields. Prolonged exposure to magnetism can disrupt the Karamatu's abilities, leaving it disoriented and weakened.

Sound: The Karamatu's howl is described as a low, ominous rumble that increases in volume as it reaches its crescendo. Its unique ability to manipulate gravity adds an eerie, otherworldly quality to the sound.
