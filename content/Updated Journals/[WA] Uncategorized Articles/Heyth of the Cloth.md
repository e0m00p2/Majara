# Article
A bard with a somewhat sharp tongue, he can take as well as he can give on most subjects. However, Vazif the Colorful is a sensitive subject and can cause him to become angry. He works with colored cloths and powders to tell stories with bursts of color from smoke or just tossed into the air.

I love a good insult, even one directed at me. I change my mood or my mind as quickly as I change key in a song. Beauty. When I perform, I make the world better than it was. (Good) I will do anything to prove myself superior to my hated rival. I have trouble keeping my true feelings hidden. My sharp tongue lands me in trouble.
