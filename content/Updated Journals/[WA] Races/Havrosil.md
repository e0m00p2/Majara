# Havrosil

# Side contents
Trinominal

homo sapien hydrargyrum

## Anatomy

Similar in general shape, bone structure, and internal organs to humans, however thats where most of the similarities end. What on humans is muscles, sinew, skin, and other flesh is made up entirely of a quicksilver, acidic substance that is mailable to the will of the Havrocilian. This odd alchemical material allows them some flexibility of morphology, though limited due to the structure of the internal organs that need be protected.

## Perception

While Havrocilians can rely on their eyesight, they tend to depend more upon their 'flesh' for information. The quicksilver material that makes up most of their body is sensitive to even the movement of the air and operates as a kind of blindsight for the Havrocilian.

## Namingtraditions

All Havrosil were named some variation of Steve in honor of a great leader in their past, though the details are now lost.

## Customs

Among the Havrosil, traditions that would be quite shocking to many modern cultures flourished. It was considered a sign of great honor for the corpse of a family member to be requested by the government to be added to the greater undead that directed civic projects. All dead were raised as some form of undead, often serving the family for generations to come as simple labor or guards. All nobles of any rank were taught the simplest methods of undead creation, while the higher forms were guarded jealously by their keepers.

Affection, or at least loyalty, is an incredibly powerful force among the Havrosil. To protect and care for those in ones circle is often the most powerful motivating force for a Havrosilian. This is often the drive that causes many to seek power in the kingdom, though an outsider would claim it was for powers own sake. A Havrosilian knows well that to protect those in his or her care, he or she must be in sufficiently good health so it is rare to see one commit sacrifices that are so lauded in other cultures, unless the Havrosilian in question has bound their own lifesource to undeath.

## History

In the oldest histories of the Havrosil, it is said that they came from another world, very different and far more dangerous than here. The name that their unusual species, never before seen on this world, came to be called is said to be rooted in that past though it was lost. With some hardship, the Havrosil tamed their surroundings, rooting themselves in this new place. At first they expanded quickly, taking over a considerable chunk of Majara, but after some time infighting began between several factions. It is suspected that this is where most of the information of their past was lost, as the factions assaulted and destroyed each other in large amounts, often targeting places of knowledge as the Havrosil were all natural wizards with specializations in summoning and necromancy, as well as a dark form of enchantment. Between vicious infighting and attacks from the other races of Majara who rallied at their foes weakness, the remaining Havrosil were forced into what is now [[Updated Journals/[WA] Countries/Barban|Barban]] and fortified their lands, stabilizing their society. While the civil unrest continued, it was on a smaller scale and kept hidden from enemies who might seek to take advantage of their weakness. Here they build their great pyramids, build their golems, and created legions of undead workers to serve the kingdom.
