# Article
Endlessly curious and inventive, these folk have a unique sense of humor. Whether their colorful outfits and odd hairstyles are a unique tradition or some ongoing prank is a matter of debate. Outsiders often underestimate them based on their eccentric appearance and behavior, to their chagrin.

Visitors are surprised by clockwork contraptions powered by wind, sun, steam, coal, or magic for purposes from the most mundane to incredibly complex and powerful. All the best devices feature multiple 'improvements,' generally fulfilling the expected purpose, but likely ten unrelated things as well.

## Anatomy

Gnomes were very small compared to most other races and, with an average height ranging between 3′0″‒4′0″ (0.91‒1.2 m)\[1\] and a weight range of 40‒45 lb (18‒20 kg), gnomes were generally larger and heavier than halflings, though forest gnomes – ranging between 2′1″‒2′10″ (0.64‒0.86 m) in height and 21‒35 lb (9.5‒16 kg) in weight – tended to be smaller than halflings, leading some scholars to erroneously classify all gnomish races as "smaller than the Hin".

While halflings were commonly said to resemble short humans, gnomes were more comparable with [[Elf|Elves]], with whom they shared pointed ears and high cheekbones, or even [[Dwarf|Dwarves]], due to their tendency to grow beards and live underground. Many gnomes had a more feral appearance than either, however, with hair that often sprouted from their heads in odd directions.

The skin of gnomes ran in hue from reddish tans to earthy browns or even shades of gray, with exact hue somewhat dependent upon the ethnic origin of a gnome. Similarly, gnomish hair varied wildly in color from blond and brown to more exotic colors like white, orange, or even green. Gnomish eyes were often—particularly in individuals who were native to the Feywild—glittering black\[9\] or blue, although more natural eye colors were also known to the race.

## Perception

Like many of the races of Majara, Gnomes have excellent darkvision, being able to see 60 feet in darkness as if in dim light.

## Genetics

Born from a pile of Feywild gemstones and a joke from [[Vel Tuck Entasida]], the King and/or Queen of Gnome gods, gnome reproduction does not much resemble the breeding of natural races. Instead, when ready to have a child, a Gnome will acquire a Feywild gemstone, either personally or via the Birthing Vault, a location found in every major Gnomish city. 

Once acquired, a gnome will spend years speaking to this gemstone in day to day life about their interests and what they are doing, showing and telling good jokes and planned pranks. Over time, the gemstone will change shape as if sculpted by a master craftsman into the form of a tiny gnome. At a particularly good joke or interesting discovery, the gemstone shell will shatter explosively (birth is a dangerous event) leaving behind gemstone fragments and a baby gnome.

## Naming traditions

Gnomes tend to pick up names like humans pick up enemies, finding new ones wherever they go. Among other races, they tend to pick their three favorite, though not always the same three causing much confusion when traveling.

## Gender ideals

Gender is a very fluid concept among Gnomes as there is no hard line between male and female. While they do possess sex organs, they are not used in reproduction but for entertainment and tend to change several times over a gnomes lifetime. They do try and pick one and stick with it when they stay with other races as it makes them uncomfortable to refer to someone as a 'he' one day and a 'she' the next.
