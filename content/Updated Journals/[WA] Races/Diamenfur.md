Die-Men-Fur

## Anatomy

In their natural state, the Diamenfur resemble nothing so much as a common octopus, in both apperance and size. However, the internal workings of these fel creatures was far more dangerous. While their eight limbs were much the same, the beak of the Diamenfur was sharply pointed and more dense. They also have a ninth tentacle of a sort, called the Fur, woven individually prehensile strands. These are charged with psionic energy and allow for the use of certain powerful abilities when in contact with the brain of another creature. If they manage to create a hole in a creatures skull and insert this appendage, they can harmlessly freeze the creature indefinitely. During which time, the Fur allows them to innately understand the creatures make up and duplicate its minds chemical productions. This allows them to do what makes them terrifying to most sentient races: consume the head of the creature and place itself upon the creatures neck, its Fur twining into the body and allowing them to control it like a puppet, even maintaining the bodies good health for as long as they ride it.
