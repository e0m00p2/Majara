## Deity: The Essence Beyond Belief

In the vast cosmos of the multiverse, where planes of existence intertwine and collide, the concept of _'Gods'_ emerges as an intricate tapestry woven from the **Soul of [['The One']]**—an ancient being whose demise birthed the very essence that permeates realms beyond the material. These divine entities, ranging from demons and angels to fey and more, are manifestations of the spiritual fabric that defines the cosmic landscape.

### Origins of Divinity

Within the intricate weave of reality, divinity rises from the various planes of existence. Demons, angels, and fey emerge naturally, akin to the growth of crystals or the collaborative efforts of similar entities. **Deities**, however, are a unique phenomenon. Unlike their counterparts, these powerful beings do not form spontaneously. Instead, they arise from the concentrated _'faith'_ or _'belief'_ of the remnants of sentient races left behind by **[['The One']]**.

### The Power of Belief

The essence of a deity is shaped by the collective belief and fervor of sentient beings. The more individuals dedicate their thoughts and prayers to a particular concept, the more likely it is for a corresponding deity to take shape in the outer planes. This gives rise to beings of immense power, intricately tied to the hopes, fears, and aspirations of those who worship them.

### The Curse of Knowledge

However, the might of a deity comes at a profound cost—the burden of omniscience. Deities are intimately connected to the desires of their mortal worshippers, their very existence shaped by the beliefs and convictions of the masses. If the perception of a deity shifts, if the collective faith wavers or transforms, the deity undergoes a corresponding metamorphosis. This truth, a closely guarded secret among deities, serves as both the source of their strength and vulnerability.

### Immutability of Deities

Short of being shaped by mortal faith, deities cannot generally be changed or destroyed permanently as long as they stay in the planes, for these planes are composed of the same substance as the deities. Any damage done is healed by drawing on the power of the very surroundings, rendering conventional combat pointless. The exception to this occurs when gods manifest on the material plane—a realm with little to none of the substance of divinity. Here, damage affects the very concept of the deity, visible even upon their return to the planes, as it becomes a permanent part of them. This is why gods and goddesses rarely manifest and operate themselves on the material plane, preferring to work through intermediaries such as clerics, paladins, and avatars.

### Channeling Divine Power

Clerics, paladins, and avatars are mortals or semi-mortals who have gained enough resonance with the deity's power to channel their vast capabilities in the form of spells, rituals, and miracles. Even so, gods and goddesses must exercise caution not to overpower the delicate mortal frame with their might, as excessive divine influence can consume and burn away the worshiper entirely.
