# Article
Shifters are commonly believed to originate from the different -Thropes that exist in [[Majara]]. However, this is actually untrue. Shifters were born at the same time as the -Thropes, as a side effect of the magic of [[The Great Growth]]. When the divine magic of the powerful event tore through what is now known as [[The Fertile Lands]], many things were changed. Those in the process of hunting or stalking creatures were struck by this magic and changed. Their attention along with the magic reverberated and changed them, causing a 'Bond'  of sorts to form and traits of one passing on to the other. Shifters were born of all the now so called 'Civilized' races. Unfortunately, during such dark times as they were then, the races were more cautious and fearful.  Many a shifter was killed when attempting to return to clan or family, leading to their limited numbers today, particularly among humans.

## Anatomy

Similar to the parent species, shifters can resemble [[Elf|Elves]], humans, [[Gnomes]], halflings, or even [[Dwarf|Dwarves]]. However, they all share several traits that strengthen after adolescence.

1.  Shifter ears are slightly pointed even if the parent race didn't have pointed ears. Furthermore they are furred or down feathered along the edge and back, sometimes lightly inside as well. 
2.  Shifters have more pronounced canine teeth, to the point that they could be mistaken for vampire fangs at a glance.
3.  Shifters nails are harder and grow sharper and longer than the parent species. 

Outside of these, before adolescence a Shifter might be mistaken for a member of the parent species. After the bond, more traits related to the bonded creature will often emerge, making them more notably animalistic.

Perception

All shifters share Darkvision and keen senses. Wildhunt shifters however have the most acute senses.

## Genetics

Shifters can breed with any species that their parent species could, plus each other. Any child of a shifter and another race has a chance to gain the bond or not. If they do, they are born a Shifter, if not they are born a full blooded member of the other parents race.

## Growth Rate

Shifters live the same as their parent species in growth rate, but they have a unique feature that manifests around puberty. They form a 'bond' with an animal species. Often based on a childs most admired animal or sometimes just the only ones they are exposed to, they gain certain traits of the animal. Interestingly, though this bond changes the body and mind of the shifter, it has no effect on the animal in question and grants no particular rapport between shifter and that species.
