Genetics

Same as humans and [[Elf|Elves]], half-elves reproduce as many mammals.

## Growthrate

Unlike [[Elf|Elves]], half-elves take after their human parentage, advancing quickly to mental and physical maturity both. However, once an adult this slows down considerably, letting them live two to three times as long as the average human.
