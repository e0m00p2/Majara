**Komodo - A Precursor Race of [[The Fertile Lands]]**

The Komodo were one of the five dominant races in [[The Fertile Lands]] before [[The Great Growth]] event destroyed most of them, leaving only fragments. The Komodo, along with the other precursor races, are now revered for their ancient knowledge and technology. The Komodo, in particular, were known for their advancements in medicine, poisoncraft, and wild magic.

**Appearance**

Komodo were physically imposing creatures, typically standing between 6 to 7 feet tall and possessing great strength. They were ambush predators with a potent natural venom and a swift sprint. They had limited interest in socialization and were known to be ambush predators.

**Society and Culture**

The Komodo were not known for their social skills and their "tribes" were based mostly on "survival in numbers." They did not have much interest in socializing and their tribes were structured to ensure the strength of their members during lean times. However, they were known for their open flow of knowledge, which allowed for significant advancements in their craft.

**Craft and Trade**

Komodo were known for their advancements in medicine, poisoncraft, and wild magic. They used their knowledge to create bone trinkets known as Lore Bones, which taught the methods of poisoncraft and possibly methods of shamanism. Additionally, their shamans and poison specialists worked together to create bone weapons infused with poisons that were both magical and potent. The Komodo also had the ability to breed asexually.

**Ambush predators and Weapons**

Komodo were ambush predators and relied on their strength, natural venom, and magic to hunt. They did not develop bows as their focus was on chemistry and shamanism, but they did create poisoned spears. Despite this, they were considered a dangerous threat to those who invaded their territories.

**Egg Laying and Protection**

Komodo laid full clutches of eggs, but paid little attention to their young as the strong were expected to survive on their own. However, the nests were communally protected as the baby Komodo could not defend themselves. The Komodo did not have much interest in parenting, but their focus was on survival and strengthening the tribe.

**Travel and Territory**

The Komodo were not fans of traveling and only moved when necessary. When a tribe became too large to support itself, the weakest members were driven off, causing a new tribe to form elsewhere. The Komodo did not typically fight with each other, as it was considered a waste of effort, but they were known to eat each other if necessary.

**Interactions with Other Races**

The Komodo were known as the Komodo to other races and were simply named after the place where they were commonly encountered. However, the Komodo referred to their race simply as "the people" and did not have much interest in interacting with other races. Interactions were usually aggressive and the Komodo were known to kidnap people for experimentation.

**[[The Great Growth]] and the Emergence of Lizardfolk**

[[The Great Growth]] event almost completely destroyed the Komodo and forced them to breed asexually over the next hundred years. The lack of food and resources during this time caused the Komodo to evolve into what is now known as the Lizardfolk. The Lizardfolk still retain some of the knowledge and abilities of their precursor race, but their society and culture have changed significantly
