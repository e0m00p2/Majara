## Anatomy

Goblins usually stood between 3′4″‒3′8″ (1‒1.1 m) and weighed about 40‒55 lb (18‒25 kg) on average. They had flat faces, sloped back forehead, broad noses, pointed ears, and small, sharp fangs. and their eyes varied in color from red to yellow. Their skin color ranged from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red, though they also came in shades of green. Às alchemically born creatures they have no reproductive organs in most cases.

## Genetics

As creatures of alchemy, goblins have no way of self reproduction. The alchemical method of their creation is passed down among the lair tribe, with modifications based on the location. The specifics are closely guarded secret of the goblins. Once the potion has been created it must be drunk at which point a goblin begins budding on the skin of the previous one and over the course of a few hours a young goblin breaks off from the host.

## Growthrate

Goblins grow to maturity over six months over which time they are extremely receptive to new ideas and concepts.
