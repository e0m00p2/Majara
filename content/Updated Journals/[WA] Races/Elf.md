## Genetics

Elves reproduce much like humans and other evolved species, even though they were originally children of the first Elven god, [[D'mitrius Marcus|The Great Storyteller]]

## Growthrate

Elves grow in an unusual fashion, compared to humans. Not intended to reproduce originally when created by their god, their long lives are a blessing and a curse from a human perspective. While the mind advances quickly, picking up experiences and maturity almost as quickly as a human, the body develops at a much slower pace. An elf is not physically an adult until approximately one hundred years old, the equivalent of one year of human physical growth spread out over around five. This makes elf children appear sagacious, as one who looks to be a teenager by human terms will be as old and have as much life experience as a grandfather.
