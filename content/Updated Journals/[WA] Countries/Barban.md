# Article
**Barban - Magedom of Magic**

### Structure

Barban, unlike many kingdoms or Magocracies, is governed by its [[Archmage]], who is an absolute ruler with the power to shape the kingdom's governance. Each new [[Archmage]] often redefines the governmental structure. The most recent [[Archmage]], preferring not to be involved in governance, established the current guild-based system. The [[Archmage]] selected "Head Guilds" to distribute the kingdom's management. Currently, these guilds include [[The Eldest Arcane]], Song of Time, and Those Who Watch. Bards, integral for operating the Song Gates, and [[The ATF]], with their prowess against necromancers and charm wizards, remain influential regardless of the ruling [[Archmage]]'s changes. Almost all power is concentrated in [[Updated Journals/[WA] Uncategorized Articles/New Graffoc|New Graffoc]], the capital city, as the Song Gates allow instantaneous transportation, negating the need for those in power to be spread out across the kingdom at all times.

### Culture

The culture of Barban extols the virtue of mages, particularly Wizards, Bards, Sorcerers, and some Occultists, for their inherent magical abilities. In contrast, clerics, druids, and warlocks are seen as second-class citizens. Those with minor magical talents, common in Barban, are ranked higher than non-magical individuals, who are viewed with contempt.

Guild affiliation and ranking are paramount in Barban society. Non-guild members are seen as barbarians and face higher taxation. A high rank in a respected guild is akin to nobility, especially if combined with magical aptitude.

Necromancy and parts of the Enchantment school of magic are taboo in Barban, shaping a societal aversion to these practices. Barban fashion, especially among the elite, is a reflection of this cultural milieu. Commoners typically wear light, loose robes, often cotton, with color and pattern variations signifying individual expression. The elite don more diverse and decorated garments. In the magical community, robe colors denote specialization:

*   Abjuration: Blue
*   Conjuration: Yellow
*   Divination: Gray
*   Transmutation: Orange
*   Necromancy: Light Green (rarely worn)
*   Illusion: Purple
*   Evocation: Red
*   Enchantment: Pink (less common)

### Public Agenda

*   Maintain Barban's strength through magic
*   Banish ignorance
*   Prevent the rise of undead

### Education

The city populace generally receives education in basic mathematics and literacy. Advanced education is primarily accessible to those from high-ranking guilds or with a notable magical talent.
