The Free Republic
# Article
*   A small nation formed in the ‘badlands’ between Ffodorii and [[Awstinai]]
*   Started when a full load of slaves abord ship managed to start a mutiny, causing the ship to crash into the shore in this part.
*   Some 200 people survived, starting the first town of Moirea, then nameless, several hours travel up the coast of a river, where they could not easily be seen or found by traveling slaver ships.
*   From this point, their numbers grew. The community was somewhat unusual as the slaves were of mixed races and there were several [[Elf|Elves]], a goodly portion of hobbits, some [[Gnomes]], humans, and a considerable number of half-orcs.
*   As the population grew, some broke off to form their own communities. Others decided to travel, leaving Moirea(still unnamed) entirely.
*   From these few, the rumors of a place of freedom formed in [[Awstinai]] and [[Updated Journals/[WA] Countries/Scourre|Scourre]]. Some others managed to escape and flee to here, joining the slowly growing villages and towns.
*   Others, often outcasts of their race or feeling constrained by the laws of their own kingdoms, headed to this place, joining these communities or forming their own.
*   Groups of the Shotto, the Shadar Kai Travelers, settled in this place at last, finding somewhere where they would not immediately be judged for their appearance.
*   A "Trade Center" forms in the near center of the now called Moirea, which means Free Land in Halflings, a city of sorts or at least a large clearing where people travel to set up stalls and trade with the others from different villages.
*   Unfortunately this place has become an easy location for Slavers to raid as it has no central government and defense
*   This causes the towns to start to communicate more regularly. As each is independent and functions on its own laws, they come to a compromise. Each town will send a number of representatives based on population to the Trade Center, where issues that threaten and affect all, where all are required to act, such as with the slavers, may be discussed and acted upon.
*   This has caused Trade Center to become a more permanent location as the Council built a structure to make the long meetings more comfortable. Its not long before a city has formed around them, as such travelers need a place to stay, food , entertainment.
*   Most of the different towns had at least hunters, able to use sling or bow and arrow or spear. A runner system was formed where the fastest of each town would run at first sign of slavery raid to nearest towns, and the hunters would be sent in support.
*   This first show of unity did decrease the number of lost to the slavers and started a national pride
*   The term "Republic of Moirea" becomes commonplace.
*   At some point later a powerful Elvin wizard female approaches the council. She offers to train three acolytes a year to the point that they can send messages over great distances. She points out that utility if each town fills a great tower for them to watch from, of how much more quickly aid can be called not to mention the aid of a lesser wizard.
*   She is open with the fact that she has been exiled from the [[Elf|Elven]] Kingdom and [[Updated Journals/[WA] Countries/Barban|Barban]] for interest in Shadow Magic and other generally considered less moral magics. However the benefits are too much and the council accepts, allowing her to build her own Tower at a fairly small town where she will not be likely Disturbed.
*   The council is given Three Chits per year that allow entry to her tower for training
