## **Scourre**

### Geography

Scourre is a kingdom located in a flat grassland region, characterized by a geography of vast steppes. While the land is fertile and lush during the short summers, it faces harsh winters and arid conditions that make large-scale farming impractical. As a result, the primary food sources in Scourre revolve around animal husbandry and dairy products like milk, yogurt, cheese, and butter.

### Culture and Society

The people of Scourre are renowned for their fierce fighting spirit, rooted in a unique warrior culture. Unlike conventional militaries, Scourre's society emphasizes individual strength and social bonds over strict adherence to rules and regulations. Governance in Scourre is structured hierarchically, with the Warlord at the helm.

#### Governance Hierarchy

*   **Warlord:** The Warlord holds absolute power over the kingdom, ruling through personal strength and capacity. Authority in Scourre is established through displays of superiority.
*   **Warleaders:** Thirteen Warleaders, each commanding significant power, serve directly under the Warlord. They oversee different territories within Scourre and maintain their own distinctive governance styles.
*   **Warbound:** The Warbound are leaders responsible for governing smaller regions within Scourre, following the directives of the Warleaders. The diversity in laws and governance among these territories is significant, reflecting the autonomy granted to the Warbound.

### Way of Life

Scourrans have a deep sense of loyalty to their kingdom and take immense pride in their traditions and customs. Unlike societies that emphasize blind obedience, Scourre values authority demonstrated through physical and social superiority.

Despite its reputation for its harsh warrior culture, Scourre boasts a rich history and culture. The kingdom's language, architecture, and art exhibit a blend of influences from neighboring kingdoms and cultures.

## History

The history of Scourre and its worship of the dark god [[Apollyon]] is a dark and tumultuous tale that has shaped the kingdom's culture and beliefs to this day.

Over 400 years ago, Scourre was a kingdom dominated by the followers of [[Apollyon]], a mad god of Destruction, Vengeance, and hate. Unlike other gods who worked through mortal champions, [[Apollyon]] manifested in the physical world to perform miracles, displaying its terrifying power directly to its worshippers. The people of Scourre worshipped [[Apollyon]] for its ability to strike down their enemies and grant them strength and dark blessings.

The [[Apollyon]] worshipers were divided into two factions, the Priests and the Priestesses, who constantly vied for power within the church. To gain favor with the dark god, they conducted cruel and sinister rituals, including sacrifices of civilians and other dark offerings. This fueled their power and their belief that might and dominance were the keys to achieving their goals.

However, after an extended period of suffering under the oppressive rule of the fanatical worshippers of [[Apollyon]], the civilian population of Scourre rose up in rebellion. Armed with military prowess and driven by their desire for freedom, they overthrew the corrupt priests and priestesses, toppling the cruel religious regime.

In the aftermath of the rebellion, the people of Scourre destroyed most records of [[Apollyon]] and weakened the dark [[Deity]] considerably. The memory of the dark god and the havoc it wreaked on their kingdom remained, and the experience forged a deep belief in the value of strength and the pursuit of power to protect themselves and liberate others from perceived corrupt governments.

The motto "Strength is the First Virtue" was born from this history, as it embodies the belief that their strength and military might will safeguard Scourre and bring freedom to other kingdoms by conquering the world. This belief drives their ambition to absorb other kingdoms into Scourre, seeing it as a means to achieve their vision of a world free from oppression.

Today, Scourre remains a formidable and powerful kingdom, with a warrior culture that emphasizes martial prowess and strength above all else. The memory of [[Apollyon]]'s dark influence still lingers, shaping the kingdom's determination to protect itself and reshape the world in its image.
