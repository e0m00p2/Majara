## History

The gnome singlehanded responsible for the [[Goblin]] Menace, called many things among the non gnome races particularly Matilda the Demented, there is an entire lore and mythology against the dangers of this single [[Gnomes]] exploits.

To be fair, they're not all wrong.

Matilda was born before [[The Great Growth]], one of the first of the [[Gnomes]] to make their way to the material plane from the feywild. Absolutely enthralled by this place and its stable rules and magics, she set out to learn them all, starting with alchemy. And she's still working on it to this day, so far as anyone can tell. Its truely uncertain how many odd creatures can be blamed on Matilda alone or the other generations of experimenting wizards, [[Gnomes]], alchemists, and inventors. Most people agree, probably half and half.

At this point in time she is the minder of "[[The Wacky Warrens]]"

## Genderidentity

Unlike many [[Gnomes]], Matilda has mostly settled on a gender, as its rare to see her as a male. She doesn't particularly mind being a male or being called by male pronouns when she is, but she will often mention that its annoying when 'it' catches on things.

## Education

Matilda is almost entirely self taught as many things known now were not common knowledge when she came to the material plane. Perhaps her study of alchemy would go much faster if she would communicate with others about it, but for the most part she prefers experimentation to reading, to the worlds dismay.
