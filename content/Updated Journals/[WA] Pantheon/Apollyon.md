**Overview:** Over 800 years ago, Apollyon emerged as the god of [[Updated Journals/[WA] Countries/Scourre|Scourre]], overseeing realms of destruction, vengeance, hate, and fury. The land was ensnared by a theocracy manipulated by power-hungry clerics who sought to expand and capture slaves for sacrificial rites. Apollyon reveled in the bloodshed, indifferent to the internal power struggles within [[The Path of Endless Fury]]—the church dedicated to his malevolent glory.  

**Manifestation of Madness** Apollyon, a god driven beyond the realms of sanity, manifested personally during conflicts, willingly absorbing blows from other gods. The pain seemed to only deepen his madness, fueling his hatred and fury. The origins of Apollyon's creation remain shrouded in mystery, lost to the annals of time, leaving only the enduring legacy of a god consumed by madness.  

**[[The Path of Endless Fury]]** The church of Apollyon boasted various ranks and members who reveled in punishments beyond death and cruelty beyond pain. Apollyon's indifferent stance on who ruled the theocracy only intensified the power struggles between priests and priestesses, each vying for control to appease the insatiable appetite of their dark [[Deity]].  

**Punishments Beyond Death** Apollyon's malevolence extended to the annihilation of entire cities, but his cruelty did not end there. Cursing these cities, he banished them deep beneath the earth, where perpetual darkness reigned. The cursed inhabitants were denied proper sleep, unable to die, starve, or escape their subterranean prison. Some were transformed into monstrous beings, while others descended into madness. The cities, stacked upon one another with passageways leading only deeper, became known as the **Labyrinthian Cities**.  

**The Labyrinthine Cities** These subterranean realms were a labyrinth of despair and madness. Moving through one city to the next required navigating cursed passages, ensuring that those who entered could never return. Attempting to ascend became impossible for the cursed, creating a haunting and eternal descent into the depths of darkness. The Labyrinthian Cities stood as a testament to Apollyon's sadistic creativity, a grim reminder of the consequences faced by those who drew his wrath.  

**The Great Rebellion** However, 400 years ago, the Common folk revolted en masse against the church, fueled by a collective desire to rid themselves of the oppressive influence of Apollyon. They hunted down anyone associated with the dark god, ruthlessly murdering those with knowledge and burning any books that mentioned Apollyon. This widespread rebellion significantly weakened Apollyon, possibly causing his fade from prominence. Though some small groups remain aware of him, as well as the existence of the Labyrinthine Cities, the once mighty god finds himself diminished.  

In the wake of the rebellion, [[Scourre]] bears the scars of its tumultuous history—a history marked by the rise and fall of Apollyon, the Labyrinthian Cities, and the resilience of those who dared to defy the god of destruction and madness.
