Mythraditis notes:

Wild West time style with steampunk(Elementalpunk?) elements.Â 

Class Notes: Cleric and Paladin are not allowed at this time. Druids: Those who naturally or by training bond with elementals of various natural elements, able to use them as mantles for a time to appear as creatures or other things. Warlocks: Those who are able to bind powerful spirits to them, becoming influenced by the nature of the elemental but gaining great power. Wizards: Runemasters who capture lesser spirits of specific effects in books of capture pods, allowing their energy to release in small bursts to simulate their powers. Sorcerers: Outcasts and freaks, these are those born from stormthralls who were near term when turned. They are part elemental, having their own inner essence to tap for powerful magic. Many fear these for who knows if the elemental spirit within will suddenly manifest, causing them to destroy all civilization around them. Fighter, Monk, Rogue, Barbarian, Ranger: Mostly Normal Artificer/Inventor: One of the most revered classes in this plane, those who make the magical devices powered by spirits captured by themselves or others.

Geography

A planet much like Majara though with  a moon.

## Naturalresources

Spirits: Spirits make wonderful power sources when combined with the gears, ratchets, and runes of humankinds creation, allowing trains to run on this alone with no physical power source needed, weapons to pulse with incredible power, and other odd but powerful inventions.

## History

Birthed from the plane of Mechanus due to some event, some chaos somehow touching the plane most lawful, yet formed in the wildness of the elemental chaos, a place quite like the material plane formed in appearances. Yet its underpinnings were of mechanics and the elements, causing spirits to manifest within the wilds, yet be tied ineffably to the workings of runes and gears.

## Florafauna

For the most part, this plane is much like the material one, though it also has 'creatures' of a sort known as spirits or elementals, formed out of elemental chaos and something a little material. This forms creatures like wind spirits and fire spirits, or sometimes beast spirits and iron spirits. Most of these spirits are like animals, consuming the materials that make themselves up or sometimes each other, yet all are naturally aggressive towards humans in general.

Some few of these many spirits have gained enough power to have a somewhat comprehensible form of sentience. While often alien in nature, they can, and do sometimes, communicate with mortals, convincing them to do their bidding to increase their own power in ways we rarely understand.

Ecosystem

Earth-Like

## Localizedphenomena

Wild elemental storms, driven by the fury of massed spirits, tear across the land where civilization blemishes the earth, tearing all before it asunder. While proper preparation can resist, those caught before it unawares are often turned into corpse thralls of the elementals and sometimes it leaves even more terrible effects, particularly dependent on the types of spirits driving the storm.
