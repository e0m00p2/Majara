## History

Born to [[Lana Lockquill]], a potent lawyer who made her name in the [[Updated Journals/[WA] Uncategorized Articles/New Graffoc|New Graffoc]] circles, Morgana was immediately plunged into a custody battle between two entities, a powerful demon who put his touch on her in the womb in exchange for granting wealth to Lana and an old Hag who granted immortality to Lana. In the end, Morgana was left in the hands of the hag to raise, with the demon visiting every weekend to tutor the girl in demonic magic and politics. This was a fairly tense relationship and this had its effect on Morgana who heard constant complaints about the other throughout her childhood. Additionally, Lana would occasionally show up to visit, taking her on trips to the consternation of both other parties, teaching her important ways of the world.

## Education

Educated in the ways of Hag and Demon magic, based on a mix of blood power and will. Educated well in reading, writing, deceit, and arcane lore, as well some self defense with weapons in case these artes fail, [[Morganna]] is a comparitively well educated individual.
