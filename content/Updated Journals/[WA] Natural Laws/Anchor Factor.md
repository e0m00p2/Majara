## Causes

The cause of Anchor Factor isn't 100% certain but [[Gnomes]] have submitted several speculations, the most accepted of which this is a strange divine manifestation of power based on the belief of the masses. This is supported by the fact that the powers granted by Anchor Factors are often not scientifically aligned with what they can do, rather instead aligned with commonly held beliefs by the masses.

## Transmissionvectors

Generally the condition is transmitted at the natural death of one Anchor host immediately to the birth of the next Anchor host. How Anchor hosts are chosen by the Anchor Factor is currently unknown, however there is at least one important condition that appears to remain true. Only sentient races that have existed on Majara races for several generations can be chosen by an Anchor Factor.

The Anchor Factor is never naturally infectious, but it can be "spread" to some degree. By the intent of the host, some or all of the Anchor Factor can be distributed to another sentient being or even more rarely into a liquid, solid, or gaseous form that can infect any it comes in contact with. However, for intents of the passing of Anchor Factor onto another host, the original host's lifespan remains the point at which all of the Anchor Factor evaporates and is reborn into a new host.

This has one exception: if the Anchor Factor is 'stolen' via powerful magic, the new owner counts as the original host for purposes of transmission.

Only one in perhaps five hundred have a body capable of adapting to Anchor Factor, granting them some ability related to the Anchor Factor depending on the proportion of Anchor Factor granted to them. 

Only one in ten thousand have a mind capable of holding more than a small amount of Anchor Factor. Often the stealing or even intentional granting of Anchor Factor ends in horrible disasters in this manner as the new host is driven to a madness far beyond the effects of normal Anchor Factor.

## Prognosis

As the host ages, they often gain more and more control over the Concept related to their Anchor Factor. The power and range of the Anchor Factor only increases with time until it can affect over 100 square miles with general effects.

## Symptoms

The symptoms in a natural case of Anchor Factor are both obvious and diverse. An Anchor Factor will have a specific concept it is linked to. Usually something considered a "Natural Law" but others have been recorded less commonly. Well known Anchor Factors include:

*   Gravity Factor
*   Burn Factor
*   Healing Factor
*   Weather Factor
*   Life Factor

In a natural case, approximately 4-5 years after birth regardless of race, the Anchor Factor will begin to manifest obvious influences on its concept in a small local range. Such as people not healing when a Healing Anchor is angry or sad or fatal illnesses being cured overnight when they're well. At the same time, the Anchor Factor will begin to mentally influence the host, drawing their interest to the concept itself. Life may become interested in creating new life, or encouraging life that is already there. Gravity may be drawn to create new cliffs or rivers, other natural places that show Gravities strength, ect. 

It should be noted though this is not quite a symptom exactly that the Anchor Factor will defend its host reactively in a way natural to the force. Weather may call up wind or ice to surround the host or block attacks, Healing may make the host effectively unkillable, Burn might simply turn everything in a radius to ash. This is one of the reasons that Anchor Factor is viewed in many areas to be a sickness or a natural disaster, as the defenses with time only grow more powerful.

## Treatment

There are no known ways to "Heal" an Anchor Factor. It can be "Cured" in an individual by giving it to another individual if one has sufficient control. With a great deal of control, one can manifest it physically which is another way one can be "Cured". However, neither of these prevents the Anchor Factor from passing onto another at time of host death. If the host is kept pacified with drugs or magic, the effects of the Anchor Factor on the world can be minimized but as often as not, the concept is made somewhat unreliable in the area of the host.

## Reception

[[Elf|Elves]]: [[Elf|Elves]] are the most accepting of Anchor Factors. In fact, in High [[Elf]] culture these people are considered Sages, protectors of the Concept they are granted. Unfortunately, they do recognize the dangers Anchor Factors raised by other races or more commonly not raised. Among the High [[Elf|Elves]], the young Anchors are carefully taught, shown the limits and capacities of their powers until they have a strong control of it. They are encouraged to socialize with others, often with several powerful wizards to help the Anchor feel comfortable as the Wizards can prevent damage from accidents.

[[Gnomes]]: [[Gnomes]] are arguably just as accepting of Anchor Factors, most other races just wish they weren't. Due to the [[Gnomes]] more erratic nature, they don't often teach the importance of control as the [[Elf|Elves]] do, instead focusing on "What If" that the Anchor Factor manipulation allows. Anchor's among them often are as well adjusted as any other Gnome and honestly don't seem any different from most members of their race... except that their attempts to help the world via invention or creation go wrong far, far worse. While a general Gnome tinker might blow up a room or even a building... a Gnome Anchor can level cities with their help with a single Oops. And the creations often linger for centuries. 

Most Other Races: Most other races don't have the strength of will or cohesion to raise an Anchor safely. In fact, many are too uneducated to know what an Anchor is and just belief the child is god cursed or otherwise evil. These children end up having to run or be killed, or more commonly kill their entire town or city on accident. Either way, these Anchors tend to end up badly educated, badly socialized, and all around unadjusted. These are the dangerous Anchors that are considered "Natural Disasters" among all the races as they often act without thinking and without full control of their abilities.
