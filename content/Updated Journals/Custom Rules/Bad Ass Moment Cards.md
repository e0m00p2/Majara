# Bad Ass Moment Cards
BAM Cards add an element of excitement and creativity to gameplay. Each player can use a BAM Card once per story arc to pull off an extraordinary feat, such as escaping a perilous situation or revealing hidden backstory, basically gaining the ability to add a non mechanical story event in play. However, BAM Cards cannot be used to defeat bosses. Once a BAM Card is used in an arc, it cannot be used again until the next one, ensuring fair distribution among players. This mechanic encourages players to think creatively and enhances the storytelling experience in D&D sessions.
