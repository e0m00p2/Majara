# Death Throes
When a player decides a PC is to die permanently, they may drastically alter the outcome of the scene in any way that is remotely reasonable. This choice will end with a character who is unable to be resurrected as their spirit will feel they have filled their needs via dying. This could be anything from "last minute burst of strength" to "instant return as a spirit and or angel of power" so long as it ends with the character permanent out of the players control.
